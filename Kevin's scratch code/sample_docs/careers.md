        Working at Pinecone has been great for my career growth. I get to work on features that put me outside my comfort zone, which strengthens my technical skills. I get to take ownership of projects and make a true impact on the product.

        Collaborating with an international team is a fun and culturally enriching experience. The management team is trusting and caring, and I'm constantly impressed by the faith in the engineering team.
